<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
    As a highly skilled and versatile engineer <b> Linux Kernel Engineer/Developer</b>, I have extensive
    experience working with a diverse range of technologies, including <b>Rust</b>, <b>C++</b>, <b>C</b>,
    <b>Linux</b>, <b>Assembly</b>, <b>Operational Systems in General</b>, <b>Python</b>, <b>Shell Scripting</b>,
    <b>Bash</b>, and <b>Embedded Systems</b>.

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
    <b>Systems Engineer, Embedded Software Engineer and Computer Science undergraduate</b>, have strong
    interests in <b>Low Level</b>, <b>Linux</b> and <b>Embedded Systems Programming</b> and a lot of curiosity
    for new and exciting experiences. Extensive background in <b>computational simulation research</b> and
    <b>embedded systems development</b>, researched his entire graduation around these topics, building a strong
    experience in them.

    Also, possessing around <b>3 years of corporative experience in web technologies</b>, developed a good amount
    of knowledge about software engineering methodologies and processes. In spite of his Web Development
    Background, changed his career target to an area that has more affinity and knowledge,
    <b>systems and embedded programming</b>.

    Finally, having an extensive background -- and his heart -- in <b>systems engineering</b>, wishes to find an
    exciting company to contribute and learn a lot about this field. Its objectives include, but are
    not restricted to, developing knowledge working with smart people aligned to his goals, working
